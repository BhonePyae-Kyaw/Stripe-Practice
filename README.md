## ðŸ’³ Overview of Card Payment Flow in a Web Application

![Payment Overview](images/card_overview.png)

This diagram illustrates how online card payments are processed step-by-step:

1. **Customer enters card details**
   - The customer inputs their card information (card number, expiry, CVC) on the merchant's secure checkout page.
   - The data is transmitted securely via **SSL/TLS**.

2. **Merchant forwards payment details**
   - The merchant securely forwards the card data to a **Payment Gateway** over SSL.

3. **Payment Gateway processes request**
   - Validates and encrypts the payment information.
   - Converts it into a standard message format (e.g., **ISO 8583**).
   - Forwards the request to the **Payment Processor**.

4. **Payment Processor (via Acquiring Bank) routes request**
   - Works with the **Acquiring Bank** to send the transaction to the **Card Association** (e.g., Visa, Mastercard).

5. **Card Association identifies issuing bank**
   - Determines which **Issuing Bank** is responsible based on the card number.
   - Routes the request accordingly.

6. **Issuing Bank verifies and authorizes**
   - Checks the cardâ€™s validity, CVC, expiration date, available balance, and applies fraud checks.
   - Sends back an authorization response (approved or declined).

7. **Response travels back to the merchant**
   - The response follows the same route in reverse:
     - **Issuing Bank** â†’ **Card Association** â†’ **Payment Processor** â†’ **Payment Gateway** â†’ **Merchant**
   - The merchant displays the payment result to the customer.
